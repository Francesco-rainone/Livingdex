/// This file centralizes the application's routing configuration using the `go_router` package.
/// It defines all the navigation paths, their corresponding screen widgets, and the overall
/// navigation structure, including a shell route for persistent UI elements like a navigation bar.
///
/// The `router` object defined here is intended to be used with `MaterialApp.router`
/// in the main entry point of the application (e.g., `main.dart`).
///
/// The routing structure includes:
/// - An initial splash screen.
/// - A `ShellRoute` that provides a persistent scaffold with a navigation bar.
/// - Child routes for the main sections of the app (Home, Chat, Settings) that render within the shell.

/// Defines the primary application routes that are nested within the `ShellRoute`.
/// These routes represent the main sections of the app accessible via the
/// persistent navigation bar provided by the parent `ShellRoute`.
/// Defines the primary application routes that are nested within the `ShellRoute`.
